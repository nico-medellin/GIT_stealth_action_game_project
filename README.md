# GIT_stealth_action_game


Cyber Clash is a stealth action game where you play the role of a secret agent who is trying to free his comrades from robotic guards. Use stealth elements, grenades, and rocks to distract and disable guards while you search for your team.

Be careful, if you get caught by any of the guards, that marks the end of your team's journey.


A link to the zip file for both the Mac and Windows download can be found here. Check out the game! There is about 10 minutes worth of gameplay!

Trailer for the game can be found here! If the embedded video doesn't work, I'm attaching a video file as well. The link to the video can be found here.
